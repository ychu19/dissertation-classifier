## Purpose

My dissertation project seeks to explain why permanent immigrants in Japan refused to acquire Japanese citizenship even when they were born and raised there <sup>1</sup>. I hypothesize that their home country attachment through diasporic organizations affects their propensity to naturalize.

I pulled the naturalization records from the Japanese Government Gazette ([官報](https://search.npb.go.jp/kanpou/)), with information about each and every naturalized individuals in Japan since the 1950s. I focus on the time between the 1971 and 1980, with a total of 72,416 individuals who have naturalized.

This document presents a smaller project within my dissertation - **classifying the country of origin for each naturalized individual**. The information about naturalized citizens from the Gazette includes (a) their names, (b) their names before naturalization <sup>2</sup>, (c) their residential addresses, (d) their dates of birth, and (e) dates of approval. While the Gazette provides a rare and valuable opportunity to look into the individual-level features of naturalized citizens, it does not include information about their countries of origin. Fortunately, the Gazette did include original citizenship for those who naturalized in the 50s. **This project uses the data from 1954 to 1955 as prior to predict the countries of origin for those who naturalized in the 70s.**

[2]: Prior to 1983, most of the applicants to naturalization were implicitly asked to change their names to a Japanese-sounding name. [See Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_nationality_law#Naturalization).
